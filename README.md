## Installation

#### CocoaPods
You can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install `KarhooUISDK` by adding it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby

use_frameworks!
pod 'KarhooUISDK', :git => 'https://github.com/Karhoo/karhoo-ios-ui-sdk.git', :tag => '1.2.6'
```

then import `KarhooUISDK` wherever you want to access Karhoo services

``` swift
import KarhooUISDK
```

# Setup For Development 
Install Cocoapods 
`brew install cocoapods`


Run 
`pod install`

Open  KarhooUISDK.xcworkspace 

## Running Tests
There is an Xcode scheme for unit tests. Unit tests test the functionality of individual classes using mocked dependencies. 

## Client example
There is an example project inside the Client directory of this repository. This is meant to be a fast way to test SDK changes and development steps.  You will need to add access Keys to the client module as these are ignored due to this being an open source repository. 

```swift
struct Keys {
static let identifier = ""
...
}
```
