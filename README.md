<h1>Karhoo iOS UI SDK</h1>

The UI SDK extends on our [**Network SDK**](https://github.com/karhoo/karhoo-ios-sdk) with ready to use screens and views for your end users to book rides with [**Karhoo**](https://karhoo.com/) in your application.

For more general information about the SDKs, chechout [**the karhoo developer portal**](https://developer.karhoo.com/docs/build-apps-using-sdks)

## Installation

#### CocoaPods
You can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install `KarhooUISDK` by adding it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby

use_frameworks!
pod 'KarhooUISDK', :git => 'https://github.com/Karhoo/karhoo-ios-ui-sdk.git', :tag => '1.2.6'
```

then import `KarhooUISDK` wherever you want to access Karhoo services

``` swift
import KarhooUISDK
```

## Usage

## Initialisation

There are a few things the UI SDK needs to know before you can get started. Such as what environment to connect to, or what kind of authentication method to use. These dependencies can be set up in an implementation of the KarhooUISDKConfiguration protocol.

```swift
import KarhooUISDK

struct YourCompanyKarhooConfiguration: KarhooUISDKConfiguration {
    
    func environment() -> KarhooEnvironment {
        return .sandbox
    }

    func authenticationMethod() -> AuthenticationMethod {
    // for other authentication methods such as guest or token exchange bookings please see: https://developer.karhoo.com/docs/using-the-network-sdk#authentication
        return .karhooUser
    }
}
```

With this configuration the UISDK can be initialised in your App/SceneDelegate. This will also ensure the network layer (KarhooSDK) is initialised. 

```swift
import KarhooUISDK

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                     didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        KarhooUI.set(configuration: YourCompanyKarhooConfiguration())
       ..
        return true
    }
}
```

For full documentation of SDK services please visit our Developer Portal: https://developer.karhoo.com/reference#user-service

## Authentication

The KarhooSDK requires authentication, attempting to interact with the SDKs without authenticating will result in errors. There are three possible authentication methods supported:

### Karhoo User

A user that is created and managed within the Karhoo platform. Karhoo users are useful for corporate travel and proof of concept integrations. Setup your KarhooSDKConfiguration interface authentication method as ```.karhooUser```. Then you can use the UserService to make a login request with a username and password.

```swift
let userService = Karhoo.getUserService()
let userLogin = UserLogin(email: "your-user@email.com", password: "abc")

userService.login(userLogin: userLogin).execute { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let user):
        print("user authenticated: ", user)
    case .failure(let error):
        print("error: \(error.code) \(error.message)")
    }
}
```

### Guest User

Guest users are anonymous and useful for B2C traveller solutions. When booking as a guest user, the user of your application will not be required to authenticate, however you will be required to provide passenger details when making a booking with the trip service. To setup the SDK in guest mode, specify the authentication method in your KarhooSDKConfiguration interface as ``` .guest``` and provide your credentials as an associated value. After that, you'll be able to interact with the SDK services. 

```swift
struct YourCompanyKarhooConfiguration: KarhooSDKConfiguration {
    
    func environment() -> KarhooEnvironment {
        return .sandbox
    }

    func authenticationMethod() -> AuthenticationMethod {
        return .guest(settings: GuestSettings(identifier: "", 
                                              referer: "", 
                                              organisationId: ""))
    }
}
```


### Token Exchange

It is also possible to sync your users with the Karhoo platform so you can swap your users JWT token for a karhoo user token. This allows your users to automatically authenticate and use Karhoo services. If your integration involves this authentication method you can setup the SDK accordingy using the ```AuthService```

Firstly, specify ```.tokenExchange``` as the authentication method in your SDK configuration file.

```swift
struct YourCompanyKarhooConfiguration: KarhooSDKConfiguration {
    
    func environment() -> KarhooEnvironment {
        return .sandbox
    }

    func authenticationMethod() -> AuthenticationMethod {
        return .tokenExchange(settings: TokenExchangeSettings(clientId: "", 
                                                              scope: ""))
    }
}
```

Then use the ```AuthService``` to swap your JWT for a Karhoo user.

```swift
let authService = Karhoo.getAuthService()

authService.login(token: "user-jwt").execute { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let user):
        print("user authenticated: ", user)
    case .failure(let error):
        print("error: \(error.code) \(error.message)")
    }
}
```

## Features

Once the SDK is authenticated you can use it to show pre-built but customisable UIViewControllers and UIViews. Consider this framework like a UI API. You feed certain parameters into the view controllers and views, and your end users interactions with the views triggers actionable output.  

### Screens

Within ```KarhooUI().screens()``` are a selection of UIViewControllers. The full list of available screens are listed [**here in our developer portal**](https://developer.karhoo.com/reference#uk-sdk-address-screen). The SDK uses the builder pattern to generate UIViewcontrollers and UIViews, inside the builders the sdk initialises and binds business logic to the UI so interactions are handled, Here's an example of how to build the main booking screen:


```swift

private var bookingScreen: BookingScreen?

bookingScreen = KarhooUI().screens().booking().buildBookingScreen(journeyInfo: nil, // prefill origin / drop off / date data
                                                                  passengerDetails: nil, //prefill booking details with customer info
                                                                  callback: { [weak self] result in
                                                                        switch result {
                                                                        case .completed(let bookingScreenResult):
                                                                            switch bookingScreenResult {
                                                                            case .tripAllocated(let trip): print("did book trip: ", trip)
                                                                            default: break
                                                                            }
                                                                        default: break
                                                                        }
                                                                    }) as? BookingScreen
self.present(bookingScreen!, animated: true, completion: nil)

```

### View Components

As well as UIViewControllers the SDK offers the UIViews that make up its UIViewControllers. This can be helpful if you want to have more control over your end users experience, or integrate very specific features into your app, such as choosing addresses or booking an existing quote. Avialable components are found in ```karhooUI.components```. Here's an example of the address bar from the booking screen.  

```swift

import KarhooUISDK

private var addressBar: AddressBarView!

addressBar = KarhooUI.components.addressBar(journeyInfo: nil) //prefill component with data. eg a pickup address
view.addSubview(addressBar)

// setup constraints on the component
_ = [addressBar.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: navigationBar.bottomAnchor),
     addressBar.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor, 
                                         constant: 10.0),
     addressBar.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor,
                                          constant: -10.0)].map { $0.isActive = true }

```

## Customisation
You can override aspects of the screens and components to align the UI SDK more towards your own brand. This includes the colour scheme, font, translations and custom routing within screens.
